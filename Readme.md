6.  **Specific Use Cases:**
    * **Employee:**
        * Clock in/out: Employees can easily record their work hours using biometric authentication.
        * View attendance records: Access a personal attendance history for transparency.
        * Receive notifications: Stay informed about schedule changes or important updates.
        * Request time off: Submit leave requests through the system.
    * **Administrator:**
        * Manage employee information: Add, update, or remove employee profiles.
        * Configure settings: Customize system parameters to align with company policies.
        * Generate reports: Obtain insights into attendance patterns and workforce performance.
        * View system performance: Monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

## Installation and Usage:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm from the official website.
    * Verify the installation by running:
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
    * (Optional) Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if using it for version control.

2.  **Backend (Express.js):**
    * Clone your Biometric Attendance System repository:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/biometric-attendance.git](https://github.com/yourusername/biometric-attendance.git)
        cd biometric-attendance
        ```
        *(Remember to replace `https://github.com/yourusername/biometric-attendance.git` with your actual repository URL)*
    * Install the required Node.js packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    * Configure environment variables (e.g., database connection details, API keys) in a `.env` file.
    * Start the Express.js server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

3.  **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):**
    * Place your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a `public` or `static` folder.
    * Link your CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML.
    * Test locally by opening your `index.html` or main HTML file in a web browser.
    * Ensure communication with the backend (e.g., AJAX requests to API endpoints).

4.  **Usage:**
    * Access the Biometric Attendance System by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port in your Express.js configuration).
    * Explore the attendance tracking features and personalized recommendations. *(This part seems like a leftover from the previous description and might need adjustment for this project)*
    * Connect with others, chat with friends, and share your favorite features. *(Again, this might need adjustment as it's a biometric attendance system)*
